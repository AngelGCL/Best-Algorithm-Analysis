# Best-Algorithm-Analysis
This is a Data Structure course project which analyses different algorithms to find different phone numbers for a police investigation (fictional)

Run the FilesGeneratorMain class to generate input files to test the program. Some classes have been implemented by my professor to help test our results and compare them to his own.
